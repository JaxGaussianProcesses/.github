# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to JaxGaussianProcesses!

[JaxGaussianProcesses](https://jaxgaussianprocesses.com) is dedicated to creating a flexible ecosystem of [Gaussian process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_process) modules for researchers in [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax):

* [GPJax](https://github.com/JaxGaussianProcesses/GPJax): Gaussian processes in JAX,
* [MOGPJax](https://github.com/JaxGaussianProcesses/MOGPJax): Multi-output Gaussian processes in JAX,
* [JaxKern](https://github.com/JaxGaussianProcesses/JaxKern): Kernels functions in JAX,
* [JaxLinOp](https://github.com/JaxGaussianProcesses/JaxLinOp): Linear operators in JAX,
* [JaxUtils](https://github.com/JaxGaussianProcesses/JaxUtils): Model training utilities in JAX.

Development is lead by [Daniel Dodd](https://github.com/Daniel-Dodd) and [Thomas Pinder](https://github.com/thomaspinder).
