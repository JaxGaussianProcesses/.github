# Welcome to JaxGaussianProcesses

JaxGaussianProcesses is dedicated to developing an ecosystem of Gaussian process modules in [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax). Management of JaxGaussianProcesses is carried out by [Daniel Dodd](https://github.com/Daniel-Dodd) and [Thomas Pinder](https://github.com/thomaspinder). 

The packages within this organisation can be described as follows 
* [GPJax](https://github.com/JaxGaussianProcesses/GPJax): Defining Gaussian process priors and posteriors, sparse schemes, and inference techniques.
* [MOGPJax](https://github.com/JaxGaussianProcesses/MOGPJax): Multi-output Gaussian processes.
* [JaxLinOp](https://github.com/JaxGaussianProcesses/JaxLinOp): Efficient operations for linear operators.
* [JaxKern](https://github.com/JaxGaussianProcesses/JaxKern): Kernels in JAX.
* [JaxUtils](https://github.com/JaxGaussianProcesses/JaxUtils): Auxiliary functions and objects for the JaxGaussianProcesses ecosystem.
